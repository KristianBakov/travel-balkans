        <p>The Balkan peninsula mountains are amazing. Largely undiscovered and untouched by progress with beautiful
            alpine
            mountains but without the crowds of the Alps. Here are some pictures from people who have had elevated
            experiences with us.</p>

        <p class="quote">Wow!
            This journey reaffirmed my passion for mountains.
            After taking one of these trips, I can confidently declare that they are both my favourite geographical
            feature and my favourite M-word. </p>

        <p class="quote">I've never understood why people are so obsessed with mountains.
            But then I went on one of these tours.
            People who <em>don't</em> care for mountains no longer make sense to me. </p>
        <p class="author">- Michael Braddock</p>
        <p class="quote">Go to the mountains if you want to understand the universe.
            Seriously, I mean it.
            It's like, wooooooooow.
            You know what I mean?
            It's like that. </p>
